I.I. Notes
---

The basic notes of Music are:

**C    C#    D    D#    E     F    F#    G    G#    A    A#    B**

Don't let the number of names fool you. Music isn't all about the individual names of notes. Instead, visualize it like this:

And.. thats pretty much all you need to know about notes really. You only need to know that there is a difference from one note to another.

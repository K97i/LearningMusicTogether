* [InspirAspir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2z02J4fJwg) - I actually learned most of what I say here from this video alone. It is better in every way than this document, as it goes indepth with it's topics. It is definitely worth a watch if you want to go knee deep in learning how to write music.

* [Adam Neely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUfJZJofdj8) - His content focuses on real world examples of music theory and delves deep into the topics at hand.

* [12tone](https://www.youtube.com/c/12tonevideos/videos) - Like Adam Neely, he analyzes real world examples of music theory. If you want to start writing your own compositions, you should check him out.

I. Basic Music Theory

a. Notes
---

The basic notes of Music are:

**C    C#    D    D#    E     F    F#    G    G#    A    A#    B**

Don't let the number of names fool you. Music isn't all about the individual names of notes. Instead, visualize it like this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105120272/167262780-869b1e6a-3343-4118-928a-257abdbb2464.png)

Commonly, these are also combined with numbers on the side. These numbers correspond to **it's octave.** 

Take for example: A4

This note is most used for tuning actual pianos.

Scales
---

Now you know the basic notes, let's move on to scales.

You'll find that the most common types of scales are the **Major** and **Minor** scales. But what are these scales?

Let's start with the **Major** scale.

**A major scale is a type of scale based on the white notes from C-C.** If you lay out a C Major scale in a piano roll or play it on an actual piano, you will see that it is quite easy to play, as it is just the white keys.

Based on this, if you are using a *Digital Audio Workstation* (DAW)

**Draw the white notes from C to C:**

**Then move all of the notes to whichever root note you want:**

and with that, ***we have just made an A Major scale.*** (Called that because the first note is now A.)

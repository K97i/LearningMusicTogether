* [InspirAspir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2z02J4fJwg) - I actually learned most of what I say here from this video alone. It is better in every way than this document, as it goes indepth with it's topics. It is definitely worth a watch if you want to go knee deep in learning how to write music.

* [Adam Neely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUfJZJofdj8) - His content focuses on real world examples of music theory and delves deep into the topics at hand.

* [12tone](https://www.youtube.com/c/12tonevideos/videos) - Like Adam Neely, he analyzes real world examples of music theory. If you want to start writing your own compositions, you should check him out.

I.a Notes
---

The basic notes of Music are:

**C    C#    D    D#    E     F    F#    G    G#    A    A#    B**

Don't let the number of names fool you. Music isn't all about the individual names of notes. Instead, visualize it like this:

Commonly, these are also combined with numbers on the side. These numbers correspond to **it's octave.** 

Take for example: C4 also known as middle C.

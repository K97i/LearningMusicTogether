I. Basic Music Theory
===

a. Notes
---

The basic notes of Music are:

**C    C#    D    D#    E     F    F#    G    G#    A    A#    B**

Don't let the number of names fool you. Music isn't all about the individual names of notes. Instead, visualize it like this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105120272/167262780-869b1e6a-3343-4118-928a-257abdbb2464.png)

*(image used and modified from: https://www.musikalessons.com/blog/2016/08/piano-keys-chart/)*

Commonly, these are also combined with numbers on the side. These numbers correspond to **it's octave.** 

Take for example: A4

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105120272/167279079-35f0fac0-2bb4-476b-9269-504863c9e0d5.mp4

This note is most used for tuning actual pianos.

b. Scales
---

Now you know the basic notes, let's move on to scales.

You'll find that the most common types of scales are the **Major** and **Minor** scales. But what are these scales?

Let's start with the **Major** scale.

### Major Scale

**The major scale is a type of scale based on the white notes from C-C.** If you lay out a C Major scale in a piano roll or play it on an actual piano, you will see that it is quite easy to play, as it is just the white keys. 

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105120272/167279413-e039b28f-a161-489d-936e-cbdb1be19277.mp4

Based on this, if you are using a *Digital Audio Workstation* (DAW)

**Draw the white notes from C to C:**

![DrawCtoC](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105120272/167279835-91f9436a-32d8-4b18-ad5f-b60e08ad20e5.gif)

**Then move all of the notes to whichever root note you want:**

![MoveCtoC](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105120272/167279892-c8a5fe01-bf13-422e-8e11-a813e2f21410.gif)

and with that, ***we have just made an A Major scale.*** (Called that because the first note is now A.)

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105120272/167281485-58f5f40c-4fc3-4245-a983-901ff3dbd771.mp4

### Minor Scale

If Major Scales are all happy sounding, Minor Scales are in the opposite corner. They are more emotional sounding, in context.

**The minor scale is a type of scale based on the white notes from A-A.** Now you may think there is no difference, because it's the same 7 keys. **There is a difference.** It makes a difference because of where we start our scale.

For example, look at the difference between C Major (left) and **C Minor** (right)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105120272/167281766-020d64d6-822a-4782-92ec-8853ee53d2b9.png)

*(Blue signifies difference of major from minor, Red signifies difference of minor from major)*

You'll see that there are different notes in each scale because of where we started.

C Major:

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105120272/167279413-e039b28f-a161-489d-936e-cbdb1be19277.mp4

C Minor:

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105120272/167283714-9dbefaa4-3a03-4171-a863-b12a8ba317fe.mp4

Hear the difference? The minor scale is usually used for more emotional songs like sad songs.

To make a minor scale in any key:

**Draw the white notes from A to A:**

**Then move all of the notes to whichever root note you want:**

![MoveAtoA](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105120272/167282028-a1b5a64f-d557-475a-8f35-082f07554075.gif)

and with that, ***we have just made an C minor scale.*** (Called that because the first note is now C.)

c. Chords
===

Now that we know the scales, let's learn about **chords.**

Did you know that you can play more than one note at the same time? Crazy world we live in. But it's true. You should have heard of what is a chord by now, but if you haven't:

**Chords are multiple notes that are played simultaneously.** The simplest of which is called a *triad.*

You are already familiar with scales so these names shouldn't scare you:
There are two main (and common) types of chord triads: Major Chords, and Minor Chords.

### Major Chords

Major Chords, in its simplest form, is three notes in a specific pattern of 1 - 5 - 8 (or, in traditional Music Theory, 1-3-5)

Let's make an E major triad:

#### Major Triad Creation

Place your root note

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105120272/167283222-e62e5998-5f20-4fd9-91f1-7c7b6ebcf7e7.png)

Follow the pattern 1-5-8 (if E is 1, then F is 2, and F# is 3, and so on)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105120272/167283241-3e597d70-1f70-4202-8824-e3dfed0c16c6.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105120272/167283249-87bdf49b-c789-426f-a36f-ffa44cc21ecd.png)

and with that, we constructed an E major triad.

### Minor Chords

Minor Chords, on the other hand, have a pattern of 1 - 4 - 8 (or, in traditional Music Theory, 1-b3-5)

Lets make an E **minor** triad:

Place your root note

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105120272/167283586-39257530-7cbc-4e18-9a5a-74e952dc2ff5.png)

Follow the pattern 1 - 4 - 8 (if E is 1, then F is 2, and F# is 3, and so on)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105120272/167283607-f7aa26b8-5265-4f4b-889c-30f49c55b883.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105120272/167283615-5f1346b4-5156-4811-a11c-863a3309c620.png)

and with that, **we constructed an E minor triad**

Now you might not think that one note can make the difference, but it does. Listen to them:

E major triad:

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105120272/167283830-0b996d40-6f8c-4bf6-b863-97f30afa4fec.mp4

E minor triad:

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105120272/167283853-8ab50831-692d-4d83-b360-d9ff4f84dcba.mp4

Hear the difference? Only one note changed and it changed the feel of the chord.

d. Chord Progressions
===

Does this chord progression remind you of anything?

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105120272/167284693-a3790810-d19d-4fef-a390-bbe6574138f6.mp4

What if we changed its key? Can you guess?

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105120272/167284699-e3784c8e-4698-4fb0-8313-73d79b39ac1e.mp4

What if we slow it down?

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105120272/167284707-e1fec826-27fa-46b2-908f-bef4a62aa8a0.mp4

What if we add the melody to it?

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105120272/167284717-43e53f1b-fd0c-4eb0-b51e-f67016355b1c.mp4

Yes, it's Alan Walker - Fade. Get mad. 

How is it that you can't recognize the song from the chords only? Its time to talk about chord progressions

(All examples in this topic will be in B major)

Let's say we want to make a song, and lets say it doesn't matter if its generic as it could possibly be. Then we need to use the **Four Chords of Pop**

### The Four Chords of Pop

The Four Chords of Pop are I, V, vi, and IV but these are meaningless to you because you dont understand them. Let's put it this way:

Under the rules of scales, in B major:

B - I (tonic)

C# - ii (supertonic)

D# - iii (mediant)

E - IV (subdominant)

F# - V (dominant)

G# - vi (submediant)

A# - vii° (leading tone)

*(Uppercase Roman Numerals means major chord, Lowercase Roman Numerals means minor chord)*

If we apply the Four Chords of Pop, our chords are:

B (I), F# (V), G# (vi), E (IV)

Now to choose a pattern:

You can choose any pattern you like! I will go with I-IV-vi-V (B-E-G#m-F#)

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105120272/167285880-2518ecd6-3695-4ab9-983f-5c4d7a7b98c0.mp4

Now thats a Chord Progression. You don't have to stick to the Four Chords of Pop, but this is a great start point for understanding music theory.

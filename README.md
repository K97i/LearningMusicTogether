# LearningMusicTogether
A collection of what I learned of Music Theory, Music Composition, and Music Production.

# Q&A

## Why make this?
I saw a lack of free guides that are all in one package for music in the internet. So I sought out to fill it in myself.

## Can you fix X?
Probably not. As I say in MusicTheory.md, I am not a professional. Unless it stirrs up chaos in the internet, I probably won't fix it. 

Also, reread the top line of this markdown file.
